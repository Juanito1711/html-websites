    <h2 style="background-color: white">How to Achieveng a Net Zero?</h2><hr>

    <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> In June 2019, legislation passed requiring the Government to reduce UK net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 100% on 1990 levels by 2050. Achieving this will make the UK a ‘net zero’ emitter. Most SMEs say that they are aware of this commitment to “Net Zero”, with just one quarter (25%) admitting they do not.

        Where greater challenge arises is with understanding and action. A significant proportion of SMEs (40%) said they did not know how the Net Zero goal would affect their business. This lack of insight also reflects in SMEs not fully recognising the opportunities of Net Zero beyond the benefits of protecting the environment and cost savings. When asked what benefits there may be, just one-in-five listed employee engagement and attraction (21%), customer expectation (19%), or new investment as opportunities (15%) from Net Zero.</p><hr/>
    
        <h2 style="background-color: white">Getting a help</h2><hr>
    <p style="color: whitesmoke;"> For support on Net Zero, most SMEs say they would turn to the internet (71%) and Government (70%) as key sources. Many of the small businesses have yet to take advantage of resources available from banks, such as Lloyds’ sustainability hub. On average, only four-in-ten SMEs (42%) would turn to their bank, a figure that falls to just one-in-five among near-microbusinesses (20%). </p> <hr/>
